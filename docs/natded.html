<h2>Natural Deduction</h2>
<p>In general, arguments are more complicated that those we&#x27;ve considered
    so far. Here, for example, is an argument that has five premises:</p>
    <div style="width: 10%;">
        (p∧r)→s<br/>
        q→p<br/>
        t→r<br/>
        q<br/>
        t<hr/>
        ∴s
    </div>
    <p>Is this argument valid? Of course, you could use a truth table
    to check whether the conjunction of the premises logically implies
    the conclusion. But with five propositional variables, the table
    would have 32 lines, and the size of the table grows quickly when
    more propositional variables are used. So, in general, truth
    tables are not practical.</p>
    <p>Fortunately, there is another way to proceed, based on the fact that
    it is possible to chain several logical deductions together.
    For example, if P⊢Q and Q⊢R, it follows that P⊢R. This means we can demonstrate the
    validity of an argument by deducing the conclusion from the
    premises in a sequence of steps. These steps can be presented
    in the form of a proof:</p>
    <blockquote><p>A <strong>formal proof</strong> that an argument is valid consists of a
    sequence of propositions such that the last proposition in the
    sequence is the conclusion of the argument, and every proposition
    in the sequence is either a premise of the argument or follows
    by logical deduction from propositions that precede it in the list.</p></blockquote>
    <p>The deduction rules, the primitive argument forms that we will chain
    together into complete proofs, are described in more detail below.
    One of the characteristics of natural deduction is that there are
    rules associated with each logical operator that determine how to
    either <em>introduce</em> or <em>eliminate</em> the operator. This can provide
    a great deal of guidance when writing a proof, because as you fill
    in the steps you can look at the main operators of the current goal(s)
    and the available premises—either you will work backwards from
    a goal by use of an introduction rule or you will work
    forwards from a premise by use of an elimination rule.</p>
    <p>The existence of such a proof shows that the conclusion follows
    logically from the premises, and therefore that the argument is
    valid. Here is a formal proof that the argument given above is valid.
    Each proposition in the proof is justified by a subproof using an appropriate rule.</p>

    </natded-proof>
    <p>Once a formal proof has been constructed, it is convincing. Unfortunately,
    it&#x27;s not necessarily easy to come up with the proof. Usually, the best
    method is a combination of working forward (&quot;Here&#x27;s what I know, what
    can I deduce from that?&quot;) and working backward (&quot;Here&#x27;s what I
    need to prove, what other things would imply that?&quot;). For this proof,
    I might have thought: I want to prove s. I know that p∧r implies s, so if I can prove p∧r, I&#x27;m OK.
    But to prove p∧r, it&#x27;ll be enough to prove p and r separately….</p>
    
    <h2>Natural Deduction Rules</h2>
    <p>As mentioned above, the particular set of primitive argument forms that
    we will use are grouped into <strong>introduction</strong> and <strong>elimination</strong> rules
    for each of the logical operators. Here we will explain each deduction
    rule, justify it, and show examples of how they may be used in proofs.
    At the end of this section is a table summarizing all of the rules.</p>
    
    <h3>Conjunction</h3>
    <p>The conjunction p∧q is true when both p and q are true. Therefore,
    to introduce the conjunction p∧q in a proof we need to first establish
    the premises p and q individually:</p>
    <natded-proof static>
        <and-intro expr="p\land q">
            <unknown-intro slot="left"></unknown-intro>
            <unknown-intro slot="right"></unknown-intro>
        </and-intro>
    </natded-proof>
    <p>The name of the rule is given as "∧-Intro", and the conclusion p∧q is
    shown after the colon on the top line of the rule box. The nested proof blocks, labeled with
    question marks, are "holes"; in a complete proof, they will be filled with appropriate
    subproofs for the corresponding propositions, p and q.</p>

    <p>Here is an example of how this rule might be used in the proof of ¬p, p∨q ⊢ ¬p ∧ (p∨q). Note
    how the premises are available through the names h<sub>0</sub> and h<sub>1</sub>.</p>
    <natded-proof static>
        <theorem-intro name="Example 2" expr="\lnot p\land(p\lor q)">
            <hypothesis-item slot="hypothesis" expr="\lnot p" id="h8"></hypothesis-item>
            <hypothesis-item slot="hypothesis" expr="p\lor q" id="h9"></hypothesis-item>
            <and-intro>
                <var-intro slot="left" ref="h8"></var-intro>
                <var-intro slot="right" ref="h9"></var-intro>
            </and-intro>
        </theorem-intro>
    </natded-proof>

    <p>The elimination rules for conjunction allow us to move from the premise p∧q
    to either the conclusion p or the conclusion q:</p>
    <natded-proof static>
        <and-elim1>
            <unknown-intro expr="p\land q"></unknown-intro>
        </and-elim1>
        <and-elim2>
            <unknown-intro expr="p\land q"></unknown-intro>
        </and-elim2>
    </natded-proof>

    <p>Here is a proof that combines the introduction and elimination rules for conjunction
    to prove p∧q ⊢ q∧p, <em>i.e.</em>, that AND is commutative:</p>
    <natded-proof static>
        <theorem-intro name="And Commutative" expr="q\land p">
            <hypothesis-item slot="hypothesis" expr="p\land q" id="h12"></hypothesis-item>
            <and-intro>
                <and-elim2 slot="left">
                    <var-intro ref="h12"></var-intro>
                </and-elim2>
                <and-elim1 slot="right">
                    <var-intro ref="h12"></var-intro>
                </and-elim1>
            </and-intro>
        </theorem-intro>
    </natded-proof>
    <p>Note that we used the second elimination rule in the first subproof to extract q from the hypothesis,
    while we use the first elimination rule in the second subproof to extract p. We can also break out the subproofs using a "Let" block, so that we can give them names; this is often useful when building up a proof in the "forward" direction:
    <natded-proof static>
        <theorem-intro name="And Commutative v2" expr="q\land p" id="_9081639142377751" class="">
            <hypothesis-item slot="hypothesis" expr="p\land q" id="h12"></hypothesis-item>

                    </and-elim2>
                </bind-item>
                 <and-intro id="_4772809978776298" class="">
                    <var-intro id="_9867255212883266" ref="_35283901950914354" slot="left"></var-intro>
                    <var-intro id="_14589877526446227" ref="_6067291412996603" slot="right"></var-intro>
                </and-intro>
           </let-block>
        </theorem-intro>
    </natded-proof>

    <h3>Implication</h3>
    <p>The implication p→q says that whenever p is true, q must also be true.
    To introduce an implication in a proof, we will temporarily assume p and show that,
    based on that assumption, we are then able to conclude q.
    As a deduction rule, this argument will take the form of a <em>nested</em> proof, analogous to
    a nested block of code that may introduce temporary local variables, or a function
    definition that may use parameters. The notation we will use for this is inspired by the
    notation for an anonymous function block in languages such as JavaScript, Scala, and
    ReasonML:</p>
    <natded-proof static>
        <implies-intro expr="p\rightarrow q">
            <binder-node id="_3541487636465035">
                <unknown-intro></unknown-intro>
            </binder-node>
        </implies-intro>
    </natded-proof>
    <p>The indented subproof after the double arrow (⇒) is like the body of a function where an additional
    parameter is available: the hypothesis h<sub>0</sub> which allows us to temporarily assume p.
    Just as with parameters and local variables, we are not allowed to use this hypothesis outside of the
    nested subproof; it would be incorrect to conclude that p is true more generally, beyond the scope of
    this introduction rule.</p>

    <p>Here is an example of a proof of the tautology (since a tautology may be viewed as an argument
    with no premises) p→p:</p>
    <natded-proof static>
        <theorem-intro name="Example 3" expr="p\rightarrow p">
            <implies-intro>
                <binder-node id="h13">
                    <var-intro ref="h13"></var-intro>
                </binder-node>
            </implies-intro>
        </theorem-intro>
    </natded-proof>

    <p>A Theorem box may show some features that we have not seen yet.
    The natural deduction environment embedded in this page can also be used to construct proofs, although
    all of the examples we have seen so far are uneditable.
    If a proof under construction contains "holes", marked with a question mark (?), then that proof is
    incomplete, indicated by the cross-hatched background on the Theorem box. In an active proof environment,
    you may interact with these holes to incrementally complete the proof, for example by dragging a
    hypothesis for the desired proposition, or by selecting a rule from the toolbox. There are also
    keyboard shortcuts for all of these actions; for example, if you type "&I" followed by the Return
    key, that is equivalent to choosing the And-Introduction rule, while "h0" enters a reference to
    hypothesis h<sub>0</sub>.</p>
    
    <p>As an exercise, see if you can complete proofs of the tautologies p∧q → p∧q and p∧q → q∧p.
    The first should be very simple, while the second will require some of the proof rules from the
    previous section. Hint: start by clicking on the toolbox button and selecting the →-Intro rule, then
    see what remains to be shown to prove each theorem.</p>
    <natded-proof>
        <theorem-intro name="Exercise 1" expr="p\land q\rightarrow p\land q">
            <unknown-intro></unknown-intro>
        </theorem-intro>
        <theorem-intro name="Exercise 2" expr="p\land q\rightarrow q\land p">
            <unknown-intro></unknown-intro>
        </theorem-intro>
    </natded-proof>

    <p>The analogy with defining a function taking the hypothesis p as a parameter and returning
    the conclusion q is not accidental. The elimination rule, which you may recognize as our
    old friend modus ponens, is very much like function application: if we have a proof of
    p→q, and we can also supply an argument that p is true, then we may conclude
    that q is true. Just as a function body describes how to takes an argument passed in through
    its parameter and compute a result, the subproof that establishes p→q tells us
    how to take an argument (!) for p and produce the extra steps needed to conclude q.</p>
    <natded-proof static>
        <implies-elim>
            <unknown-intro expr="p\rightarrow q"></unknown-intro>
            <unknown-intro slot="arg" ref="h15"></unknown-intro>
        </implies-elim>
    </natded-proof>

    <p>Here is a proof of the argument p→q ⊢ p→p∧q:</p>

            </implies-elim>
            </and-intro></binder-node>
            </implies-intro>
        </theorem-intro>
    </natded-proof>

    <h3>Disjunction</h3>
    <p>To prove the disjunction p∨q, it is enough to prove either p or q alone. This leads to
    two obvious introduction rules:</p>
    <natded-proof static>
        <or-intro1 expr="p\lor q">
            <unknown-intro></unknown-intro>
        </or-intro1>
        <or-intro2 expr="p\lor q">
            <unknown-intro></unknown-intro>
        </or-intro2>
        </theorem-intro>
    </natded-proof>

    <p>Here are two distinct proofs of the argument p∧q ⊢ p∨q:</p>
    <natded-proof static>
        <theorem-intro name="Example 5a" expr="p\lor q">
            <hypothesis-item slot="hypothesis" expr="p\land q" id="h19"></hypothesis-item>
            <or-intro1 id="_3543999278841876">
                <and-elim1 id="_8738896025278633">
                <var-intro id="_08643825735158961" ref="h19"></var-intro>
            </and-elim1>
            </or-intro1>
        </theorem-intro>
        <theorem-intro name="Example 5b" expr="p\lor q">
            <hypothesis-item slot="hypothesis" expr="p\land q" id="h20"></hypothesis-item>
            <or-intro2 id="_6741951532134307">
                <and-elim2 id="_7239562739112437">
                <var-intro id="_5484711538501019" ref="h20"></var-intro>
            </and-elim2>
            </or-intro2>
        </theorem-intro>
    </natded-proof>
    <p>Although they have the same premises and conclusions, these two proofs are
    giving fundamentally different reasons why the conclusion follows from the
    premise. Note that in the introduction rules for disjunction, one of the terms
    in the disjunction appears &quot;from nowhere&quot;. The argument in proof 1 could
    equally well conclude p∨r from the premise p∧q, where r could
    be anything; however, the argument in proof 2 would allow us to conclude
    instead r∨q for any proposition r.</p>
    
    <p>This peculiar behavior of disjunction extends to the elimination rule. Whereas
    the introduction rules appear to be duals of the elimination rules for conjunction,
    the elimination rule for disjunction is significantly more complicated that just
    a dual of the introduction for conjunction.<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>
    What we have is essentially a <strong>case analysis</strong>—to eliminate
    an OR, we need to conduct two subproofs (nested as in the →-Intro rule), one
    for each possible case. Here is the rule, with holes for the bodies of the subproofs:</p>
    <natded-proof static>
        <or-elim expr="r">
            <unknown-intro expr="p\lor q"></unknown-intro>
            <binder-node slot="left"><unknown-intro></unknown-intro></binder-node>
            <binder-node slot="right"><unknown-intro></unknown-intro></binder-node>
        </or-elim>
    </natded-proof>
    <p>In words, this says that we have our disjunction, p∨q, which in this case comes from hypothesis
    h<sub>0</sub> of the theorem, plus two nested subproofs. The first
    subproof needs to conclude the "result" proposition r from the additional premise p, while
    the second subproof  must conclude the same result r from the alternate premise q. Since we
    know that either p or q is true at this point in the proof, we are able to
    conclude r regardless of which it is.</p>
    <p>Here is a proof that OR is commutative (p∨q ⊢ q∨p):</p>
    <natded-proof static>
        <theorem-intro name="Or Commutative" expr="q\lor p">
            <hypothesis-item slot="hypothesis" expr="p\lor q" id="h22"></hypothesis-item>

            </or-intro1></binder-node>
            </or-elim>
        </theorem-intro>
    </natded-proof>

    <h3>True and False</h3>
    <p>We may think of True (⊤) as a conjunction of zero things: it is true whenever all of
    those (zero) things are true, <em>i.e.</em>, it is always true. Compare this with taking
    the sum of an empty set of numbers: the result is 0, which is the identity for +,
    just as ⊤ is the identity for ∧. Using this analogy, we get one introduction
    rule for ⊤ (with zero premises) and zero elimination rules:</p>
    <natded-proof static>
       <true-intro></true-intro>
    </natded-proof>
    <p>In words, we may conclude ⊤ at any time with no premises. This is not generally
    useful, but we include it for completeness.</p>
    <p>Similarly, we may think of ⊥ as a disjunction of zero things, noting as above that
    ⊥ is the identity for ∨. It is false unless at least one of those zero things
    is true…. This suggests that we get zero introduction rules and
    one elimination rule, which just has the premise ⊥ and zero nested subproofs:</p>
    <natded-proof static>
        <false-elim expr="r">
            <unknown-intro></unknown-intro>
        </false-elim>
    </natded-proof>
    <p>That is, if we have a proof of ⊥, then we can produce a proof of
    any arbitrary proposition r! Logicians like to refer to this as <em>ex falso quodlibet</em>,
    &quot;from falsehood, anything.&quot; If your premises are consistent, you should never be able
    to prove ⊥ at the top level of a proof; if you could do that, then you could use
    this rule to prove anything whatsoever. This rule is useful in nested proofs (for
    example in disjunction elimination, doing a case analysis), where if a temporary
    assumption leads to a contradiction then we can conclude anything in that subproof,
    secure in the belief that that assumption will never actually be true.</p>
    <p>Here is an example, where we validate the common argument that if we know that either
    p or q is true, and we know that p implies false, then q must actually be true:</p>

    <h3>Negation</h3>
    <p>Since the laws of Boolean algebra tell us that ¬p ≡ p→⊥, we could simply derive the rules for
    negation from those for implication, specialized to the conclusion ⊥. However, it is
    convenient to have rules explicitly to deal with negation. There is also one
    additional rule for negation that does not fit the pattern of the rest of the rules
    (see below).</p>

    <p>Accordingly, here is the introduction rule for negation:</p>
    <natded-proof static>
        <not-intro expr="\lnot p">
            <binder-node>
                <unknown-intro></unknown-intro>
            </binder-node>
        </not-intro>
    </natded-proof>
    <p>In words, this says that to prove ¬p, we show that the temporary assumption of p leads
    to a contradiction. That is, the inner proof, with an additional hypothesis h<sub>0</sub>
    available to assert that p is true, is able to arrive at a proof of ⊥.
    </p>

    <p>Similarly, here is the elimination rule for negation:</p>
    <natded-proof static>
        <not-elim>
            <unknown-intro></unknown-intro>
            <unknown-intro slot="arg" expr="p"></unknown-intro>
        </not-elim>
    </natded-proof>
    <p>That is, one way to demonstrate a contradiction is to have proofs 
    of both ¬p and p. Compare these rules to →-Intro and →-Elim,
    and confirm that they are just the special case of rules for p→q where
    q is ⊥.</p>
    
    <p>Using these, here is a proof of one direction of the equivalence between
    p→q and its contrapositive ¬q → ¬p:</p>
    <natded-proof static>
        <theorem-intro name="Contrapositive 1" expr="\lnot q\rightarrow\lnot p">

    <p>If you try to prove the other direction of this equivalence, you will
    have a surprisingly difficult time. In fact, it is possible to show that
    there is <em>no</em> proof of the argument ¬q → ¬p ⊢ p→q
    using the rules seen so far.<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>
    The closest you will be able to get starting from
    the premise ¬q → ¬p is to conclude p → ¬¬q:</p>

    <p>Although you may be tempted to just erase the double negation, in a formal proof you
    need to justify every step, and it turns out that we do not have any way yet to
    prove ¬¬q ⊢ q! Therefore, the very last rule we will add (apart from
    wrapping up some loose ends in the next section) is the rule of double negation
    elimination:</p>

    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
    <p>As a convenience, once we have proven the validity of some
    argument p<sub>1</sub>, p<sub>2</sub>, … ⊢ q, we may reuse that proof in
    future proofs as if it were another deduction rule:</p>
    <natded-proof static>
        <theorem-intro name="My Theorem" expr="q" id="t1">
            <hypothesis-item slot="hypothesis" expr="p_1"></hypothesis-item>

    </natded-proof>
    <p>Note that we may perform any consistent substitution for the propositional variables
    in the argument. (In a real example, "My Theorem" would need to be a completed proof of a valid
    logical argument, but hopefully this gives the idea.)</p>

    <p>In programming terms, using an already proven theorem like this is
    analogous to calling an already written function out of a library.</p>

    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>To apply all this to arguments stated in English, we have to
    introduce propositional variables to represent all the propositions
    in the argument. For example, consider:</p>

    <blockquote><p>John will be at the party if Mary is there and Bill is not there.<br/>
    Mary will be at the party if it&#x27;s on Friday or Saturday.<br/>
    If Bill is at the party, Tom will be there.<br/>
    Tom won&#x27;t be at the party if it&#x27;s on Friday.<br/>
    The party is on Friday.<br/>
    Therefore, John will be at the party.</p></blockquote>
    
    <p>Let j stand for &quot;John will be at the party,&quot; m for
    &quot;Mary will be there,&quot; b for &quot;Bill will be there,&quot;
    t for &quot;Tom will be there,&quot; f for &quot;The party is on Friday,&quot;
    and s for &quot;The party is on Saturday.&quot; Then this argument has
    the form</p>
    <div style="width: 10%;">
        m ∧ ¬b → j<br/>
        f ∨ s → m<br/>
        b → t<br/>
        f → ¬t<br/>
        f<hr/>

        <li id="fn-1">Part of this complication is an
        inherent asymmetry in deduction: while our arguments may have multiple premises,
        they may only have one conclusion. A rule that was somehow &quot;dual&quot; to ∧-Intro
        would need to have two conclusions. There is another formulation of logic, known
        as the &quot;sequent calculus&quot; (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequent_calculus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequent_calculus</a>), where

        is something unusual with the rule of double negation elimination. As computer
        scientists, this should actually make sense: if we think of a proof as showing how
        to compute something, then all of the rest of the deduction rules are reasonable.
        However, the double negation rule says that if we don&#x27;t have a way of showing that
        something is false, then somehow we get a proof that it is true—just because
        we run a program and it doesn&#x27;t print out the wrong answer doesn&#x27;t mean that it
        will print out the correct answer, because maybe the program will never print out
        an answer at all!<a href="#fnref-2">↩</a></li>
